# Welcome to our Scripts repository

This repository will contain all of the scripts and related information that we used as part of this project. The scripts included for our basic Ubuntu setup are scripts from the [Computer Setup Instructions](https://codefellows.github.io/setup-guide/). We used this as part of our lab 5 in ops-102d8.

These scripts help with efficiency and quickly being able to replicate systems, settings, etc. to our standards and practices.
